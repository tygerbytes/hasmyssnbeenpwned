### 🤷 Assume your SSN is <span style="color: red">already</span> compromised

Breach after breach exposes social security numbers

* [2017 Equifax breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) exposes 100M SSN
* [2021 T-Mobile breach](https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/data-breach-2021) exposes 40M SSN
* ...

## ❄️ <span style="color: red;">Freeze</span> your credit ❄️

Make it harder for scammers to open accounts in your name.

* [Equifax](https://my.equifax.com/consumer-registration/UCSC/#/personal-info) - 800-685-1111
* [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html) - 888‑397‑3742
* [Transunion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze) - 888-909-8872

<small>⚠ They may try to sell you "boosts" and "locks" but a credit freeze should be **free**. ⚠</small>

<small>🎗 You will need to temporarily lift freezes to apply for credit. 🎗</small>

{{< slide id="socialsecurityaccount" >}}

## Setup a "<span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">my</span> Social Security" account 💳

Set up an [account at ssa.gov account](https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.action) so that a bad actor can't get there first and impersonate you.

---

{{< slide id="phishing" >}}

<h2 style="font-size: 155em;">Assume every email, call, text message is a <span style="color: red;">scam</span> 🎭&nbsp;</h2>

<small>They may already have your SSN, name, DoB, drivers license, address. They want that **last bit of info** to take over your accounts.</small>

* 📵 Don't click links 
* 📵 Don't call phone numbers
* 📵 Don't respond to text messages

e.g. "Credit card company" calls about some fraudulant activity. **Hang up** and call the number on the back of your credit card

{{< slide id="simswap" >}}

## Beware the <span style="color: red">SIM swap</span>

<small>A scammer convinces your wireless carrier to transfer your number to their device. Now they receive your account verification text messages</small>

* Call your carrier and ask to set up a "**Port Freeze**".
* You will need to create a PIN. Make it long, unique, include letters if possible, and save it somewhere safe.

---

{{< slide id="better2fa" >}}

## Get better <span style="color: red">MFA</span>

<small>A SIM swap only helps a scammer if you are using your cell service to prove your identity.</small>

Wherever possible, use an authenticator app instead of your email or cell phone.

* [Google authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
* [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)
* [Authy](https://authy.com/)

{{< slide id="nossn" >}}

## 🚫 Stop giving out SSN

* Most websites and paper forms **don't need** your SSN. Make them prove their need.
* You *may* be able to use an [EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/how-to-apply-for-an-ein) instead, but talk to lawyer / accountant first.

{{< slide id="changessn" >}}

## Can I <span style="color: red">change</span> my SSN? 🤔 &nbsp;

Even if your SSN has appeared in a data breach, you can only [get a new number](https://faq.ssa.gov/en-us/Topic/article/KA-02220) if you have already been a victim of identity theft and you *continue* to be "disadvantaged" by using the original number.

{{< slide id="contactftc" >}}

## Contact the <span style="color: red">FTC</span> 📞&nbsp;

If you're a victim of identity thieves, call the Federal Trade Commission at (877) 382-4357 and visit their [identity theft page](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/feature-0014-identity-theft).

## <span style="color:#3e7d95">About</span> 'Has My SSN Been Pwned'

It started as a just-for-grins parody site in response to the T-Mobile breach. Then I realized it could be:

1. 🎓 Educational
2. 🗃️ A central place for direct links to hard-to-find resources

> <small>"Dad, here's everything you need to [freeze your credit](#/freeze) with all 3 major credit bureaus".</small>
